# Deep Learning for Object Detection in Maritime Surveillance

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and related files for the implementation and training of deep learning models specifically tailored for object detection tasks in maritime surveillance. The focus is on leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and autoencoders to identify and track maritime vehicles and objects.

## Contents
- `TP_00_PyTorch.ipynb`: An introductory notebook to PyTorch, covering basic concepts and operations.
- `TP_02_High_level_MLP_with_PyTorch.ipynb`: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) implementation using PyTorch's higher-level abstractions.
- `TP_03_CNNs_and_transfer_learning.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating the application of CNNs and transfer learning techniques.
- `TP_06_Autoencoder_(AE)_and_denoising_AE.ipynb`: Introduction to autoencoders, including the construction of a denoising autoencoder.
- `TP_Object_DetectionV2.ipynb`: Object detection using CNNs with an emphasis on maritime vehicle detection.
- `TP_Object_Detection_Marine_Vehicles.ipynb`: Renamed version of the `TP_Object_DetectionV3.ipynb`, tailored for detecting marine vehicles.
- `dl4sequences_lab_ipynb.ipynb`: Completed object detection tasks focused on sequential data.
- `dl4sequences_lab_ipynb.rar`: Compressed file containing the `dl4sequences_lab_ipynb.ipynb` notebook and related datasets.
- `maritime_object_detection.tar`: A tar archive containing the autoencoder model and related files.

## Setup and Installation
To use these notebooks, you need to have an environment capable of running Jupyter notebooks with PyTorch installed. You can set up your environment using the following steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Unpack any `.tar` or `.rar` files using appropriate software (e.g., `tar -xvf` for `.tar` files, `unrar x` for `.rar` files).
3. Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab if not already installed.
4. Ensure PyTorch is installed in your Python environment.
5. Open the notebooks in Jupyter and follow the instructions within each notebook.
